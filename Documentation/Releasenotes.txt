3)  Window search pattern includes the following
    -  *name*         -> Name is part of the window title
    -  *name          -> Window title ends on this name
    -  name*          -> Window title starts with this name
    -  *              -> All sub windows are searched
    -  {EDIT}         -> Part of a windows class name. e.g. "Scintilla" in Notepad++
    - {n}             -> Where n is a control ID number in a dialog (sub window)
    - /               -> Continuation of the search path
    Example:
    "*Notepad/*/{RichEdit}" works in Notepad: title of the main windows ends on 'Notepad'

    '{RichEdit}' as  class name will be selected for the next action.
