THE NAME KWATTA
===============


The Kwatta monkey (*Ateles Paniscus*) is also known under the names
of the black swinging-monkey, red-faced spider-monkey or the even 
under the name 'jungle-devil' (bosduivel).
The name also refers to the Kwatta province in the country of Suriname.
Kwatta monkeys live mainly in the Guiana region of South-America in the
countries Guiana, Suriname, France-Guiana and Brasil.

Kwatta's live in groups of about 30 individuals in the high canopy of the
rainforest. In the evening, when they tuck in for the night they tend to 
make a lot of noise by making high-pitched screeching screams. The kept me
awake for many a night when I lived as a boy in that region.

THE TEST SUITE

This program is named **Kwatta** as a short for (**Kwa**li**T**y **T**est **A**pi) program.
To programmers the protests of a professional tester is somewhat like the 
screeching of the spider-monkey. After having accomplished a difficult task
in programming, the programmer sits back in humble satisfaction.
But his/her peace gets quickly disturbed by the noises of the testers
who gets busy in the aftermath of the programming day......
