PLANNING FIXES AND FEATURES
===========================

Planned features
----------------
1) Re-calculate the result of a teststep for already executed steps.
   This allows for adjusting the validations and checking that the 
   validations have been correctly modified.
   Take care for displaying the result of the step in the stepeditor.
2) Icons in the step editor for the type of step (CMD, NET, SQL, WIN)
3) Using the new BaseLibrary 2.x with std::string instead of MFC::CString
   This will allow for better portability and less dependencies.

Fixing bugs (if any)
--------------------
1) Creating a new credential set for a database teststep
   This did go wrong the first time and needed many updates before correcting.
2) File pick-and-point in NET teststep editor not working correctly
